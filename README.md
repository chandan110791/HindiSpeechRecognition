## Enhanced Whisper Model for Hindi Speech Recognition
# Overview
This repository contains the research and development work of enhancing the Whisper model for Hindi Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The project focuses on adapting Whisper to efficiently process Hindi's phonetic and syntactic complexities.

## Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Utilized datasets from Mozilla Common Voice, Gramin Voice, and IIITH, followed by rigorous preprocessing and feature extraction.
Model Training: Sequential fine-tuning of the Whisper model using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and augmented data.
Fusion Techniques: Explored deep and shallow fusion methods for decoder optimization.
Model Evaluation: Employed WER and CER metrics for robustness assessment.
## Contents
DataProcessing/: Scripts and notebooks for data preprocessing.
FeatureExtraction/: Code for extracting MFCCs and other relevant features.
ModelTraining/: Training scripts and hyperparameter tuning configurations.
Evaluation/: Evaluation scripts and comparison analysis with state-of-the-art models.

Contribution
This work contributes to theoretical and practical advancements in speech recognition, particularly for Hindi language processing.
